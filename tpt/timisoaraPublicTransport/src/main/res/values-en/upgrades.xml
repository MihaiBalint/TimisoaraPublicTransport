	<string name="upgrade_analytics_message">We have received complaints that sometimes 
	    the displayed estimates are not accurate, therefore,  we are starting a new project 
	    to improve estimate accuracy. For this project we need data and we need your help
	    to collect it. All you have to do is agree to participate in the program and use this 
	    application as you normally would. If you agree, the application will use about 10% 
	    more data than usually. Would you like to help improve this app?</string>
